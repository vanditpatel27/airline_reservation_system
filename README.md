# Airlines Reservation System

This project is an Airlines Reservation System developed in C++ that keeps track of flight numbers and decrements the seat count by 1 when a seat in a particular flight is booked. It uses object-oriented programming concepts and file handling to manage the data efficiently.

# Features
Track available flights and their seat counts.

Book a seat in a specific flight.

Decrease the seat count upon booking.

Save and load flight data using file handling.

# Requirements

C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

Standard C++ libraries

# Usage

1. Add a Flight: Input the flight number and the total number of seats available for the new flight.

2. Book a Seat: Provide the flight number for which you want to book a seat. The system will decrease the seat count by 1.

3. Save Flight Data: The system will automatically save the flight data to a file after any booking operation.

4. Load Flight Data: The system loads the flight data from the file at the start of the program.
